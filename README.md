#  Regression Machine Learning with Galaxy

This project showcases my work on building a **regression model** using the [Galaxy Project](https://galaxyproject.org/) 

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Use Galaxy’s visual interface to build a regression model.
- Predict a numerical target variable (e.g., Chronological age).
- Evaluate the model using RMSE, MAE, R², and scatter plots.
